# Anti--Skid-Braking-System
An Anti-Skid Braking System (ABS), also known as Anti-lock Braking System, is a safety system in
vehicles that prevents the wheels from locking up (i.e., skidding) during emergency braking or braking
on slippery surfaces. It helps maintain steering control and reduces stopping distance in certain
conditions.
